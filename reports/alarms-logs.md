# Alarms Logs

This section contains information and instructions for using the features accessed via the “Reports– Alarm Logs” tab in the Dimonoff \| SCMS platform.

Alarms serve to alert system administrators of issues with devices in the field. Dimonoff \| SCMS records all alarms in its database and administrators can review those alarms as a whole or by filtering for specific criteria. For example, a report can show only alarms that occur in zone X over the preceding week.
